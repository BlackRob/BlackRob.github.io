<h1>My history as a developer</h1>
<section>
<p>I have a computer engineering degree (BS, Michigan State university, 2010). When I graduated, I was about at the same level as most fresh CS graduates: strong on theory but not much practical experience. My first post-college job was as a "controls design engineer". I spent three years programming industrial computers (mostly Allen-Bradley and Siemens PLCs and HMIs for factories). It was a good experience, I learned a lot, and got pretty good at it, but it was industry-specific --I wasn't getting any marketable experience outside of the narrow field that my first job happened to be in. The next four years I spent building things, taking care of my daughter and writing. This was largely personal time, and although the gap on my resume may raise some eyebrows, I did things that were important to me, and I have no regrets.</p>
<p>The circumstances of my life have now changed, and my priorities have shifted accordingly. I have decided to focus on developing software. I am refreshing and updating my skillset, learning new technologies, and putting in the work that it takes to become a top-notch programmer. I know I will be successful because I know my personality, and my history. I've taken on large projects in the past --like building a tinyhouse-- and seen them through to completion. "Becoming a developer" is no different. I am self-motivated, not easily discouraged and am an excellent problem-solver.</p>
<p><strong>I am currently looking for a job as a software developer. Although I am an atypical candidate, some lucky company is going to take a chance on me, and they're not going to regret it. I will be an exeptional developer.</strong></p>
<p>My resume can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRCebS7SgKdQTpEXv9-H1cVoUnJRtJFCnvmp0__28kjh3kn_yqIo0fmq93YM8bDlezfQUzVyOWJwvzV/pub">here</a>, or <a href="{{site.url}}/assets/robert_austin_resume.pdf">downloaded as a pdf</a>.</p>

<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>The following sections describe software I have written. To anyone curious, most of the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/BlackRob">Github</a>.</p>
<h3>"HELLO WORLD"</h3>
<p>My first React project, "HELLO WORLD" is typed onto the screen, styled like a neon lamp, and in fact the lamp can be switched on and off. Cool, except after a few seconds the bulb in the first "O" flickers and dies. It was a fun little project to try out different techniques that I hadn't used before, like javascript promises.</p>
<p class="hasCaption"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/hellworld/index.html" rel="attachment"><img class="width75 center-block" src="/assets/hell_world.jpg" alt="screenshot of neon sign style webpage I made"/></a> my version of a "hello world" page in React</p>
<h3>Slider Puzzle</h3>
<p>A traditional sliding puzzle. My first non-trivial javascript project, as such it has a few issues with code structure, but it works, so I've decided to wait until I have more experience before I go back and refactor it. I also used Bootstrap 4 (beta), to see how it differed from Bootstrap 3.</p>
<p class="hasCaption"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/slider/slider.html" rel="attachment"><img class="width75 center-block" src="/assets/slider_puzzle_ss.jpg" alt="screenshot of sliding puzzle game I wrote"/></a> A slider puzzle game, in javascript, with Bootstrap 4</p>
<h3>freeCodeCamp</h3>
<p><a href="https://freeCodeCamp.org/">"freeCodeCamp.org"</a> prescribes a course and a series of projects, and on successful completion of the project the user has the option to be assigned to help a non-profit with their website. This provides a solution to the classical paradox, "you can't get a job without experience, but you can't get experience without a job". I have not been as diligent as I should have been about completing this program, but I will probably get back to it soon... at least I intend to do some more of the homework projects before I start on my next personal coding project. You can see which projects I've completed in <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/blackrob">my profile</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Euler</h3>
<p>I first heard about <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> while I was completing my computer engineering degree, and the first few problems I solved date to that period and used C++. I intermittently returned to the project over the years, doing a couple more each time. I later switched to writing my solutions in python because I wanted to get better at the language. <a href="https://github.com/BlackRob/Euler">My Project Euler solutions on Github</a>.</p>
