<p>The world of tiny houses is pretty small, and most of the books and resources I list here will be the same books and resources referenced by a dozen or so other tiny house blogger/builders/cheerleaders.  As I sit down to write this, I do have some inner doubt as to the "added value" of making my own list. On the other hand, it can't hurt to have another person recommending anything by <a title="a Lloyd Kahn video on Youtube" href="http://youtu.be/VKLG--xq3Gw">Lloyd Kahn</a>, can it?</p>

Lloyd describes the book best in the introduction: "This... is our survey of scaled down housing, circa 2012."  It presents all the options, from small houses on foundations to tiny houses on trailers to camper vans to sailboats.  It lays out pretty much all your options if you want to back out of the mainstream housing market.  Lloyd's written a number of other books over the years, and keeps up a <a title="Lloyd Kahn's blog" href="http://lloydkahn-ongoing.blogspot.com/">decent blog</a> and runs his own publishing company, <a title="Shelter Publications website" href="http://www.shelterpub.com/">Shelter Publications</a>.</p>

This book was an invaluable resource to me because I know nothing about architecture, but I've seen a lot of houses that look wrong, and after reading this book I have a better understanding of why.  Despite the imperative title, Ms. Cusato is <em>not</em> the architect's equivalent of a Grammar Nazi. She takes pains to emphasize that the reader can take or leave anything in the book, but if he intends to use a particular detail, say a boxed eave, this is how to proportion it right so that it doesn't look stupid.  If you are designing your own house, I highly recommend getting a copy of this book as part of your research. Better to spend fifteen bucks on a book about details before you build than to realize afterwards that your house looks cockeyed.</p>

Much of this book is not going to be directly relevant to a small home builder, as it talks about techniques to save say 50 bucks on lumber for a particular type of wall.  These parts of the book are geared towards home builders, for whom the savings will add up over time. They are less relevant to a tiny home builder. But, for a non-builder like myself, it provides a good introduction to how professionals do things, new materials and methods that I didn't know existed and practical suggestions about where to save money (what items you can buy cheap and still expect good quality, what items "you get what you pay for"). Considering it cost 20 bucks and only took a couple hours to read (I skipped the parts that weren't relevant to me), I'm satisfied that the knowledge I gained from reading it will save me more than enough to make it worthwhile.</p>

Everyone needs a framing book, this is the one I used.  It's almost 700 pages and covers just about anything I needed to know.</p>
<p><a href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600850235/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1600850235&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=workclashous-20&quot;&gt;Graphic Guide to Frame Construction (For Pros By Pros)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=workclashous-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1600850235&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;">Graphic Guide To Frame Construction</a> by Rob Thallon.<br />
A second framing book.  Not necessary, but my thinking was for 20 bucks, a second opinion on framing issues was a wise purchase.  This book has a lot of detailed drawings.  It does not always agree with the previous book, which is good, because it lets me know I don't have to take anything as gospel in either book.  Look at the examples, consider them, then use your own best judgement.</p>

Everyone needs a wiring book, this is the one I used.  Lots of pictures. Some people say that because a tiny house is on a trailer the building codes don't apply. This is technically true, but the electrical codes are there to keep people from getting killed.  Follow the electrical code.</p>

Pollan's second book is a good resource on the theory of house building.  It's about his personal experience building a writing hut on his property in Connecticut.  Not at all a "how to" book, but Pollan is an engaging writer, and his depictions of the decision making process that go into each detail are worth reading.</p>
