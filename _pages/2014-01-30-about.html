<p>Working class houses are houses designed and built on a scale suitable for those of us who have to work for a living.  Seems simple enough.  The problem comes with the word, "suitable".  It kind of implies a value judgement, like I'm looking at other people's houses, rolling my eyes and saying, "Not bad... if you're rich!" Which I kind of am.</p>
<p>Most new housing stock built in the U. S. is marketed as affordable.   Affordable for a family with two people working, they can afford to make the payments, from month to month and live the American Dream --owning their own home! Except they don't actually own it until they've paid off the mortgage after 30 years, but they get to live in it and act like they own it for the whole time which is pretty cool, I guess.  A better term for these new houses is  "purchasable". These houses are designed and built so that someone will purchase them. There's a difference.</p>
<p>When something is designed to be purchased, all of the design decisions are made to benefit the seller, not the purchaser.  A good example would be a can of iced tea.  Next time you have a can of iced tea or something similar in your hand, look at the ingredients. Do you think that some Iced Tea Chefs were sitting around, talking shop one day, when one of them discovered that adding sodium benzoate made the tea taste better?  No.  That long list of ingredients doesn't make a better tea, it makes a better product.  A product that's cheaper to make and can sit on store shelves for longer without going bad [worse].  It's the same with the housing market.  Houses are built to be sold.  The long list of features and amenities and that massive square footage, it's all put in so that the builder can sell the house easier and maximize his profit.  Not because it makes a better or more livable house.</p>
<p>Let me give my personal opinion/some unwanted advice here: if it takes you thirty years to pay for something, you can't afford it.  Even if yes, technically you can make the payments.  Thirty years!  What's left of a man after working for thirty years?  Not enough.</p>
<p>The idea of working class homes is not just that houses should be smaller or cheaper, it's that regular people --most people-- would be better off with houses on the same scale as the ones their great-grandparents lived in.  Imagine the benefits to a young couple that decided to buy a 500 square foot home near where they work instead of a 3000 square foot house in a new "subdivision". Imagine what they could do with their lives, time and money if they bought a house they could pay for in five years instead of thirty.  That should be the American Dream.   No house payment while you're still young enough to enjoy life.</p>
<p>This website is about figuring out for myself what a working class man or woman needs in a house.  What is essential, and what can be pared away.</p>
