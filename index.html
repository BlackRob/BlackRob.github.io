<p>One big nuisance: the seams between the interior panels. Â I tried filling them with various things, hoping the would cover well and leave a nice smooth surface, but may of them cracked. Â Part of the problem was that the trailer was still cold when I finished them. Not ice cold, I had a heater on, but it took several days of having the heater on to get the TH up to temperature; there was a lot of thermal mass on the inside, and at first I forgot to plug the chimney hole and the plumbing, so a lot of cold air was still coming in. Â Now that the insides are warm, it stays warm with the heater on low, but the gap fillers I tried (spackle in some spots, caulk in others) shrank quite a bit, and almost every seam cracked open. Â I redid some of them but others will be hidden, so why bother?</p>
<p>Still much work to do. I should probably be working on it right now, but the current priority-task is cutting and planing wood to finish my trim, but it&#8217;s 20Â° F and there&#8217;s a foot of snow on the ground. Â That level of loud and messy work needs to be done outside. Â So who knows what I&#8217;ll work on today.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The title is not a typo: I am not done with &#8220;my&#8221; sleeping lofts, there&#8217;s still putting up some interior sheathing, painting, trimming it up. Â I meant more philosophically, sleeping lofts in general&#8230; I&#8217;m not down with them any more. Â They seemed like a great way to get extra space and make better use of the space that I do have. But they come with problems, and for me the problems look like they outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>The first problem is stairs or ladder. You need some way to get up to the loft. Â If you choose stairs, they take up a lot of space, if you choose a ladder they still take up some space, and you often have to move them around, so now they take up two spaces: in-use and &#8220;stored&#8221;. I&#8217;ve read about a number of other options: climb up a bookshelf, or step on the kitchen counter and boost up the final three feet. Â Hell, I suppose you could use a climbing rope if you wanted to. But all of these options kind of suck. No one really wants to have to climb down a ladder in the dark to go pee. It&#8217;s annoying. I&#8217;d be very surprised if many people who sleep in lofts wouldn&#8217;t prefer sleeping in a bed a normal height above the floor. It&#8217;s simpler and easier.</p>
<p>The second main problem is headroom. Â Both above and below, you never have as much as you want. Â For my lofts, I tried to put a decent amount of height above and below my lofts, and it worked okay. Â I&#8217;ve got probably 6&#8217;6 under the lofts (kitchen and bathroom), and almost four feet in the center (peak) above. Â I tried to maximize it. Â But still, it would be nice if the kitchen and bathroom ceilings were higher, and there was more headroom in the lofts. Â But there&#8217;s nothing I can do, because math. I can&#8217;t make it it any higher and still have a road-legal trailer. Â I even used a thin loft platform and scored myself an extra two inches, but I would be hard pressed to get any more headroom. It&#8217;s a problem that you just have to live with when you choose a sleeping loft.Â <em>But if you abandon the idea of sleeping in a loft the problem disappears.</em></p>
<p>Another problem is all the extra work and cost that a loft entails. Â You need extra materials, which adds cost and weight. There&#8217;s extra labor in detailing it: finishing and trimming the top and bottom and around the edges of the loft platform. There&#8217;s the extra planning involved in the framing step so that the loft is strong and secure, and ideally has an egress window in case of emergency. A lot of extra details when you choose a sleeping loft. Â Not a big deal for someone with building experience, but for a DIYer, like many of us in the tiny house movement, the extra work is a real PITA.</p>
<p>And what do you get for it? The illusion of more space. Â There are a number of things that people have to carve out floor space for in their tiny house design. Storage, closets. Where to put a water supply / heater / furnace. And a lot of those ugly necessities get the prime space on the main floor while the humans are forced to sleep seven feet in the air. Â My solution: overhead storage and a utility loft over the bathroom. Â A utility loft &#8211;basically the area over the bathroom&#8211; doesn&#8217;t need the same amount of height as a sleeping loft. It doesn&#8217;t need to be pretty. No one is going to spend any significant amount of time chilling with the water heater. Stick that stuff up in the air, out of the way. Put up some high shelves, or racks or cabinets, or cargo nets, to still utilize the vertical space. And put a regular bed on the main floor. Â Keep it simple.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s where my thoughts are now. Â Sleeping lofts? Forget about them. If I ever build a second tiny house, I&#8217;m skipping the loft.</p>

		<p>I last attempted an update post before Halloween. Â The draft sat, and now that I finally got back to it, it was kind of&#8230; out of date. Â So, starting from scratch: this is what I have done! *** fun fact, this update itself was started a month ago, before I got distracted***</p>
<p>First, the roof is done, and the chimney is done. Â Yeah!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really happy with how the roof turned out. Â I&#8217;m not happy with how much work it was. Â Most of the hard work was my fault. I&#8217;d never done anything like this before (a steel roof, or a dormer), so there were some mistakes in my design. Â For example, the standing seam roof comes in pieces sixteen inches wide. Â The total length of my roof is not an even multiple of sixteen. Â If I had made the roof four inches longer &#8211;just an extra two inches of overhang on the front and back&#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t have had to spend the several hours trimming and custom bending the end pieces.</p>
<p>And the dormer. Â Frankly, I regret the dormer. Â I don&#8217;t regret the extra space that it gives me, but shoot, why didn&#8217;t I just extend it the whole length? As in make the entire slope of the &#8220;rear&#8221; (dormer) side of the roof at the same slope as the dormer. The extra room in the dormer section over the bathroom loft is awesome, I can sit against the wall and still have headroom, something I can&#8217;t do in the kitchen loft. Â But choosing to do a dormer, I have less room over all in my lofts, and had to pay much more in extra materials, and the extra work involved in framing and detailing the dormer, it was a ridiculous pain in the ass. Â And at the end of the day, for all that extra trouble I get less space. Â It brings to mind a comment I read on some building science site about roofing, &#8220;If you have a dormer on new construction then you designed the roof wrong.&#8221; (A horrible misquote, but I don&#8217;t feel like trying to find the page again. The idea the author expressed was that dormers, particularly shed dormers, were traditionally added afterwards, when remodeling a house, usually when someone decided that they could turn the attic into a bedroom if they just put a dormer in. If you&#8217;re building from scratch, design the amount of space you need in at the beginning.)</p>
<p>Another thing I regret: putting plumbing in the exterior walls. Â It makes for a lot of extra work. Â A better design would have avoided the extra work: cutting insulation around all the pipes, putting extra holes through my wall studs, special framing&#8230; too much extra work. Â But since I&#8217;d never built anything like this before, I didn&#8217;t know when I was designing it what I was getting myself into. Â The plumbing issues deserve a post of their own, and will get to it someday. Â For now let it suffice to say that if I ever build another tiny house, the plumbing layout will be completely different. Â But, on the bright side, the plumbing is almost done. Â I haven&#8217;t bought a water heater yet, and the sinks aren&#8217;t connected yet, so there is still work to do, but the pipes are all where they need to be, the shower is installed, and the the walls are insulated and closed up over the pipes. I probably should take some more pictures, but it&#8217;s so damn dirty inside.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s January as I write this, and the cold weather is putting a damper on how much work I get done. Â I try to put in a couple of hours every day, at least, but when I start shivering I come inside. Â I do have other things to do.</p>
<p>One detail I&#8217;d like to write about is how I framed around the fenders. The fenders are metal and exposed directly to the outside. Â I thought it was important to make sure that they were completely isolated from the rest of the inside. Â I will eventually be inserting a final piece of 1.5&#8243; foamboard in the top gap and then cover the whole thing with plywood. Â The frames are pretty rigid so standing on them never transfers weight to the fender itself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Things have been coming along on the tiny house. I am almost completely done with the siding. It&#8217;s been a long, slow process, partly due to weather and partly due to logistics. For the first: it&#8217;s been a fairly rainy summer. I obviously can&#8217;t install siding in the rain, and I like to let the sheathing dry out for at least a day before I do cover it with siding. As to the second cause of delay, the siding I&#8217;m using comes in 16&#8242; lengths. The longest piece I can put up on my own and keep it straight and level is about 7&#8242;. So I can put up siding on my own until I need to install a longer piece, then I need to wait until my eager-to-help but elderly-with-a-bad-knee father-in-law can help. And I can [will] only ask him to help for so long at a time or I know his knee will be killing him for the rest of the day. So it&#8217;s been going up slowly.</p>
<p>The siding I chose is &#8220;LP SmartSide&#8221;. It&#8217;s a composite material, like particleboard, but each individual particle is coated with some waterproofing compound before they are bonded together and shaped. It doesn&#8217;t sound awesome, but it kind of is. It&#8217;s lighter and more flexible than fiber cement, cheaper than cedar, and way better looking than vinyl. I decided to go with a traditional lap-siding approach because I want my tiny house to aesthetically look like a normal house.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also started putting on my metal roof (yeah!). And putting in my interior sheathing!</p>

		<p>I already wrote about my fall and winter side project, <a title="Things that have happened" href="http://workingclasshouses.com/?p=253">rebuilding the entrance to my In-Law&#8217;s house</a>. Well, that project is a step nearer to completion now (which puts it at about 95%): I put up the siding and the last of the exterior trim, and painted it. Still more to do: a second coat of paint, a little deck and stairs to make the step up easier, change the color of the trim around the door (the MIL thinks it needs to stand out a little). But yeah, that&#8217;s about done.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My second loft, AKA the &#8220;bathroom loft&#8221; or &#8220;back loft&#8221;, is now [almost] finished [pats self on back]. (Fun fact: this post was sitting in my draft folder titled &#8220;My second loft is finished!&#8221; for two weeks, while other obligations/projects kept me from putting the final touches on it &#8211;the loft, not the post.)</p>
<p>This loft had to be considerably different from the first for several reasons. The number one reason was that the kitchen loft was meant to have the underside of the loft boards visible, but the bathroom has to have a ceiling of its own (to keep sounds, smells and moisture out of the loft). This meant I had to come up with a way to suspend a lightweight ceiling from the bottom of the loft and keep everything tight.</p>
<p>Another major difference is the bathroom under this loft is going to be enclosed &#8211;walls and a sliding door, so I had to figure out how I wanted to build them.</p>
<p>The loft started the same, with unistrut joists and a cherry beam/joist for the front edge of the loft. Before I put up the beam, I made two wall sections for underneath it, and set the beam on top of the wall before fixing it in place.</p>

<p>The first section was normal 2&#215;4 stud wall thickness, because it had to hold the electrical breaker box. The second section was thin, because the bathroom door had to slide in front of it. I bought pocket door hardware at Home Depot, but am only building half of the pocket, so the door will be visible when it&#8217;s open.</p>

<p>I put a skin of thin (5mm) plywood on each wall, and mounted my electrical box in one, and then filled the other with foam. The idea was the foam would help block some bathroom noise, and make the wall sound less cheap and hollow. I can&#8217;t really tell if it does anything or not, so if I had a do-over I probably would skip the foam.</p>

<p>Next I put a reclaimed lumber front skin on my thin wall. This really is reclaimed lumber: most of it was originally siding and trim saved during the demolition of <a title="Things that have happened" href="http://workingclasshouses.com/?p=253">the front entrance on my In-Law&#8217;s house</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_299" style="width: 2432px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150415_174633034_HDR.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-299" src="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150415_174633034_HDR.jpg" alt="recalimed wood usedas the skin on the bathroom wall; i treated with boiled linseed oil after this picture was taken to pretty it up a little bit" width="2432" height="4320" srcset="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150415_174633034_HDR.jpg 2432w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150415_174633034_HDR-169x300.jpg 169w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_20150415_174633034_HDR-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">reclaimed wood used as the skin on the bathroom wall; i treated with boiled linseed oil after this picture was taken to pretty it up a little bit</figcaption></figure>
<p>After the walls were up, I put 5/8&#8243; tongue-and-groove OSB over the joists and screwed and bolted everything together nice and tight. I later stained and sanded the top of the OSB, then put on a couple of coats of poly. It turned out okay. I didn&#8217;t want to put too much effort into finishing this floor because it will be almost completely covered by a mattress.</p>
<p>In fact, it is now covered by a mattress. I had an old futon mattress, so I tossed it up into the loft to get a feel for it. I&#8217;ve gotta say, I like it. Sleeping with the mattress oriented this way (rather than in line with the main axis of the trailer) puts the headroom in exactly the right spot.</p>

<p>a mattress in my loft! not the most practical idea, because I still have a lot of construction to do and it will get dirty, but that&#8217;s what the old sheet is for</p>
<p>This loft isn&#8217;t completely finished, unfortunately. I still have to put up the bathroom ceiling (bottom of the loft), and add the railing and stuff. But it&#8217;s mostly done and I&#8217;m pretty happy about that.</p>

		<p>The house where I live &#8211;my in-law&#8217;s house&#8211; has a nice wooded lot behind it. They own part of it, their neighbors own part of it, their neighbor&#8217;s neighbors own part&#8230; you get the idea. One day, some guys came by in a truck and got several of the owners to agree to let them harvest a few logs out of the wood lot. They promised to pay well, and the owners gave them permission. A few days later, they arrived with bulldozers and chain saws and proceeded to wreck the woodlot. They took more trees than they said they would, knocked over or cut down trees they didn&#8217;t want but that were in their way, and seriously damaged the stream bank in several places, which led to erosion and resulted in the stream actually changing it&#8217;s course. When people complained (after only a couple days), the workers took their equipment and left. Disappeared. Paying no one.</p>
<p>Anyway, that unfortunate incident left one glaring reminder of it&#8217;s existence: this black cherry tree suspended across the stream in our backyard.</p>
<figure id="attachment_169" style="width: 2304px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_6952-e1409623726584.jpg"><img class="wp-image-169 size-full" src="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_6952-e1409623726584.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="3456" srcset="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_6952-e1409623726584.jpg 2304w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_6952-e1409623726584-200x300.jpg 200w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_6952-e1409623726584-682x1024.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">a fallen black cherry tree, across a stream in our backyard</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tree had been partially cut then knocked over. The thieves probably would have taken it, but didn&#8217;t have time. When it fell, its top got pinned between two trees on the other side, so it just hung there, never touching the ground. The tree was there all summer, fall, and winter. In spring I decided to do something about it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_170" style="width: 4320px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_20140502_100759229_HDR.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-170" src="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_20140502_100759229_HDR.jpg" alt="the cherry tree in the spring" width="4320" height="2432" srcset="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_20140502_100759229_HDR.jpg 4320w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_20140502_100759229_HDR-300x168.jpg 300w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_20140502_100759229_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">the cherry tree in the spring</figcaption></figure>
<p>It bothered me that this nice hardwood tree would just rot away. It seemed like such a waste, so I decided to harvest it.</p>
<p>The first thing to say about &#8220;harvesting&#8221; this fallen tree, was that it was really hard to do, and dangerous. I don&#8217;t recommend anyone else try this. There is no good way to cut a tree suspended like this. When the cut finally goes through, a ton of wood is going to come crashing down at or on the cutter&#8217;s feet. So I did it in a slow, indirect manner. First I cut off the tree-suspended top part in manageable chunks, then cutting through so that the suspended part itself would fall to the ground. This allowed me to stand and hold the chainsaw from a safe position. Then I stacked some of the smaller cut pieces into the stream, and levered and pulled (with a come-along) the top of the tree onto the stack, so that it was once again suspended off the ground. I could then safely cut off the top nine feet. After successfully shortening the tree, I knocked it off the stack of extras, then pushed and pulled the root end of the tree until it fell into the stream. I was finally able to safely cut the rest of the tree into two more manageable logs.</p>
<p>When I say manageable, I mean barely manageable. They were way too heavy to lift. They were almost too heavy to pull (with the equipment I had).</p>

<p>Eventually I got all three logs to the base of the hill and quartered them with a chainsaw. This took about an hour a log with an electric chainsaw. Then I hauled the dozen quarter logs up the hill by hand. This whole process took several hours on several days. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The plan had been to put the logs on my trailer and take them to a small local sawmill. But at some point I realized they were too long and heavy to put in my trailer (because I couldn&#8217;t even get them up the hill). This realization came before I quartered the logs. Once they were quartered (when a sawmill would probably be even less interested in sawing them for me), I decided to see if I could square them off myself. The original, original idea was that I could use a few beams from this tree inside my loft and it would look boss and rustic as hell, so just squaring the logs off would have been sufficient. I eventually abandoned this idea because it was too much added weight and I felt it would make the house feel less open.</p>
<figure id="attachment_214" style="width: 4320px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20140711_204254389_HDR.jpg"><img class="wp-image-214 size-full" src="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20140711_204254389_HDR.jpg" alt="" width="4320" height="2432" srcset="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20140711_204254389_HDR.jpg 4320w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20140711_204254389_HDR-300x169.jpg 300w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_20140711_204254389_HDR-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">using my trailer as a sawmill</figcaption></figure>
<p>The trailer-as-sawmill worked great, honestly. A saw with a bigger blade would have been nice. It&#8217;s not clear from the picture, but what I did was attach two 2x4s to the top surface of a table saw, put some sheets of plywood on top of my trailer, then set the table saw into a gap between the trailer joists. This resulted in the table surface and plywood being at the same level. Clamped the whole thing down and clamped down another 2&#215;4 as a guide rail, and I was good to go. I didn&#8217;t completely square off all of the logs, because I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do with them all, and figured why do extra work.</p>
<p>The better pieces of wood sat in the garage for the rest of the summer until this spring, when I turned two of the smaller ones into beams and collar ties.</p>
<figure id="attachment_279" style="width: 1080px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16779464996_d7e137d80a_o.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-279" src="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16779464996_d7e137d80a_o.jpg" alt="here are the loft beams and collar ties drying after a danish oil application" width="1080" height="1920" srcset="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16779464996_d7e137d80a_o.jpg 1080w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16779464996_d7e137d80a_o-169x300.jpg 169w, http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16779464996_d7e137d80a_o-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">here are the loft beams and collar ties drying after a danish oil application</figcaption></figure>
<p>So that&#8217;s the story of the tree I chopped up to build my tiny house. I really didn&#8217;t use much of it at all, and still have all this wood for future projects that will probably never happen. All in all it would have been a lot cheaper and easier to buy the wood I needed, but doing it this way was kind of fun.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before that I have some shortcomings as a blogger, one of them being regularity of posting. So here are some photos from last July and August, when I actually framed, sheathed and roofed my house. I&#8217;m a little disappointed in myself that during the whole process, when I had a camera-phone on my person the entire time, I took so few pictures, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I built individual sections of framing that were about at the limits of what I could lift, then got help when it was time to stand them up. I knew that when I asked for help I had to be ready to be productive. It worked out fairly well. The framing took one day, the sheathing a second. I lifted sheets of plywood up on the rafters and tacked them in place so I could cover the whole thing with a couple of tarps. I managed to get it covered just before it rained.</p>
<p>I want to thank my father-in-law, Juris (George), my neighbor John, an old friend and coworker Soo, and my brother Gary for their help with putting up the frame. I literally could not have done it without them.</p>
<p>I apparently didn&#8217;t take a single picture the entire day Gary was helping me put the sheathing on.</p>
<p>The house has been in this condition for pretty much the entire winter. After it was weather tight, I had to turn my attention to <a title="Things that have happened" href="http://workingclasshouses.com/?p=253">a different project</a>, that took up most of my time. But now I&#8217;m back at it. I ordered the siding and it should come some time this week. I built a loft. I built a ladder. I have a second loft and a second ladder started. Good times.</p>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m pretty happy with how my front loft turned out. It was a little squeaky at first. The tongue-and-groove &#8220;carsiding&#8221; is sturdy enough, but not really meant for this application, and when I moved around on the loft the boards would move slightly relative to eachother and make noise. After I put on three coats of polyurethane, the poly seeped into the joints between boards and quited it down quite a bit.</p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s done, I&#8217;m not sure I would do anything differently if I had to build this loft again. It achieves the look I wanted and is structurally sound. I might have put glue into the tongue-and-groove connection. That might have made it quieter, but I thought of that before hand and wasn&#8217;t sure it was worth the extra work.</p>
<p>I will hopefully finish the second loft soon.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/?p=108" rel="bookmark">Thoughts on making a thin loft platform</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>How much headroom do you have in a loft? Â Simple equation. Total inside height (from the peak to the finished floor) minus headroom under the loft minus thickness of the loft. Â How to get more headroom in a loft? Let&#8217;s see, raising the roof or lowering the floor are probably out of the question, and lowering the loft itself just takes away headroom from whatever room is underneath it (kitchen and/or bathroom, generally). Â The only option left is to make the loft thinner.</p>
<p>Now, let me be up front, I haven&#8217;t been in any tiny houses other than the one I&#8217;m building. My opinion that most lofts are too thick comes from looking at pictures of tiny houses, and seeing a person in a loft straining his neck to one side because he doesn&#8217;t have enough headroom. I understand, lofts are for sleeping, and you work with the space you have. But: most lofts could be built two inches thinner. An extra two inches of headroom can make a big difference.</p>
<p>Most of the lofts that I see are built with 2x4s as the joists underneath the loft. Spanning from wall to wall, spaced on 16 or 24&#8243; centers, depending on how the house was built. Then they have a platform of 3/4&#8243; planks sitting on top of that. This makes the whole platform a bit over 4&#8243; thick. Â There are two simple ways to make this platform thinner. First approach: don&#8217;t use 2x4s, use 2x2s, or ripped pieces from a harder wood. The key is to use more of them and place them closer together. Instead of attaching a 2&#215;4 to each stud, attach a ledger plate to the studs, and then sit the thinner joists on it closer together. Look at any joist span table, and you will see that different sized lumber can safely span different distances at various spacing. So, to span a 12&#8242; floor, 2x8s may be required at 24&#8243; OC, but 2x6s can span the same distance at 12&#8243; OC. See <a title="span table" href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/floor-joists-span-d_1479.html">here</a> for reference.</p>
<p>If I were making a loft this way, I would do a little test first. Screw a ledger plate (section of 2&#215;4) across two studs, and do the same on the opposite wall. Attach some 2x4s across, and sit a piece of plywood on them in the middle. Put some weight on the platform and see how much weight it can hold without bending too much. Now do the same thing but with 4 or five evenly spaced 2x2s (or ripped 2x4s). Put the same weight on it. Does it bend too much? Would you be comfortable sleeping on a loft made this way? Try adding another 2&#215;2 if it doesn&#8217;t feel stiff enough. Also, remember that when the platform surface is securely attached to the 2x2s, this will stiffen the whole structure up significantly. When the 2x2s are firmly sandwiched (glued and screwed) between two sheets of plywood, you basically have a torsion box. Hell, you can even buy torsion box panels from <a href="http://singcore.com/design/lowes-home-improvement-warehouse">Lowes</a> now.</p>
<p>The second approach (which is the one I chose) is to replace the 2x4s with steel. Steel C-channel members are readily available at Home Depot/Lowes/Menards and other places (I think I got mine at Lowes, under the brand name &#8220;superstrut&#8221;). They are used primarily for attaching conduit and HVAC equipment to ceilings. They are relatively lightweight, and they are strong. I chose this option because it looked easier than messing with a whole bunch of 2x2s. In retrospect, both approaches are probably about the same amount of work. Either way will let you build a thinner but still sturdy loft.</p>
