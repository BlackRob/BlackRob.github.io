<p>Note the sophisticated pattern --it's called "stripes"-- I achieved by staining half the boards one color, and the rest a different color!</p>

<p>Overall I'm pretty happy with how my front loft turned out. It was a little squeaky at first. The tongue-and-groove "carsiding" is sturdy enough, but not really meant for this application, and when I moved around on the loft the boards would move slightly relative to eachother and make noise. After I put on three coats of polyurethane, the poly seeped into the joints between boards and quited it down quite a bit.</p>
<p>Now that it's done, I'm not sure I would do anything differently if I had to build this loft again. It achieves the look I wanted and is structurally sound. I might have put glue into the tongue-and-groove connection. That might have made it quieter, but I thought of that before hand and wasn't sure it was worth the extra work.</p>
<p>I will hopefully finish the second loft soon.</p>
