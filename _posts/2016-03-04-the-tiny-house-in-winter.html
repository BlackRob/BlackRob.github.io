<p>One big nuisance: the seams between the interior panels.  I tried filling them with various things, hoping the would cover well and leave a nice smooth surface, but may of them cracked.  Part of the problem was that the trailer was still cold when I finished them. Not ice cold, I had a heater on, but it took several days of having the heater on to get the TH up to temperature; there was a lot of thermal mass on the inside, and at first I forgot to plug the chimney hole and the plumbing, so a lot of cold air was still coming in.  Now that the insides are warm, it stays warm with the heater on low, but the gap fillers I tried (spackle in some spots, caulk in others) shrank quite a bit, and almost every seam cracked open.  I redid some of them but others will be hidden, so why bother?</p>
<p>Still much work to do. I should probably be working on it right now, but the current priority-task is cutting and planing wood to finish my trim, but it's 20° F and there's a foot of snow on the ground.  That level of loud and messy work needs to be done outside.  So who knows what I'll work on today.</p>
