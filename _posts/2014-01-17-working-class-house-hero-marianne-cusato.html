<p>One of the major influences in the design of my tiny house was the architect Marianne Cusato. Marianne gained some level of fame for her "Katrina Cottage", intended to be permanent, affordable housing after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.* Since then, she has continued to design and advocate for small, affordable houses, good design and for livable houses and communities in general. I think she summarizes it very well in this short interview about the Katrina Cottages:</p>

<p>Search Youtube for <a title="Youtube search for Marianne Cusato" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=marianne%20cusato&amp;sm=3" target="_blank">Marianne Cusato</a> to get a better idea of her thoughts, she's pretty sharp.</p>
<p>I've read two of her books.  The first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ANSW8Y0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00ANSW8Y0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=workclashous-20">The Just Right Home</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=workclashous-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00ANSW8Y0" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, is largely about buying a house, with details on mortgages and choosing the right location. I'd already read another book on the topic, so most of it wasn't new to me, but she has a very readable style, and I enjoyed it. Although it isn't tiny or small house specific, she gives a lot of good advice, such as buying a smaller house than you can afford, choosing useable space over square footage, and valuing proximity to your other needs over just "location".</p>
<p>I also read her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402791038/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1402791038&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=workclashous-20">Get Your House Right: Architectural Elements to Use &amp; Avoid</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=workclashous-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1402791038" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> twice from cover to cover, and it was a revelation.  I was kind of surprised that I found it as useful as I did, because I've never read a book on architecture before (or wanted to), but I didn't want to design a house and have it look funny, like some houses do.  In it Ms. Cusato gives a lot of practical advice about designing and detailing a good looking house.  When I'm finished building you can judge for yourself whether or not I succeeded, but I've referred to her book and reread relevant sections probably more than any other book on my shelf.</p>
<p>* <a title="Article about small house backlash from politicians" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-cottage16dec16,0,3467479.story#axzz2qfh1W2kK">This article</a> from the LA Times about the reaction against making the Katrina Cottages permanent will probably sound familiar to people in the tiny house movement.  To summarize, local politicians claim that allowing small homes as permanent residences will lower property values and allow poor people and gypsies to move in.  What it doesn't say (but it's probably true), is that these politicians are on the same side as the corporate builders and mortgage industry, who don't want small, affordable houses providing an alternative to the oversized, unaffordable houses that they make so much money on.</p>
