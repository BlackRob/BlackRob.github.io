<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
<p>I've decided to change a number of things in my working design, which will likely entail changes to the windows, so I thought I'd post what it looks like right now, because soon it will be completely different.</p>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/current_before_bumpout.jpg"><img class="img-responsive" alt="current_before_bumpout" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/current_before_bumpout.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The changes I'm making will make the design more flexible, with less built-ins. I try to think about who will use this house in the future. I'm designing it for me and my needs, but I'm also building it to outlive me, so I want it to be easily re-purposed.</p>
