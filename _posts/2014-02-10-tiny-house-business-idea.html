<p>Not specifically tiny house, but with all these composting toilets, how about someone brings back the job of "night soil collector".  For the people who want to use a composting toilet for all it's practical benefits, but don't want to deal with the extra work they require (or for whatever reason can't have a compost pile). For a small fee, the collector will swing by your house, pick up the full buckets, replace them with empty buckets and a bag of cover material, then disappear. This would obviously only work in an area with a certain density of people using composting toilets, but for the right person might make for an adequate sideline.  Maybe someone who has access to a sawmill and plenty of clean sawdust to get rid of, or an orchard, which could provide shredded leaves for the cover material and use the compost afterward.  Or a local CSA, that might already be making weekly trips through a neighborhood.  The last one might be touchy, since some people would worry about humanure compost being used on food. It could be on a schedule or on demand (send a text, "Yo, more sawdust please").</p>
<p>This is probably already being done.  Fun fact, just about every idea I've ever had, I Iater discovered that someone else thought of it first. Really. I've reinvented so many things.  So many.</p>
