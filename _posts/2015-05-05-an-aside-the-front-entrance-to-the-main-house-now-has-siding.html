<p>I already wrote about my fall and winter side project, <a title="Things that have happened" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/02/26/things-that-have-happened.html">rebuilding the entrance to my In-Law's house</a>. Well, that project is a step nearer to completion now (which puts it at about 95%): I put up the siding and the last of the exterior trim, and painted it. Still more to do: a second coat of paint, a little deck and stairs to make the step up easier, change the color of the trim around the door (the MIL thinks it needs to stand out a little). But yeah, that's about done.</p>
