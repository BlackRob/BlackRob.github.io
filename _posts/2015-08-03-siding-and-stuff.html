<p>Things have been coming along on the tiny house. I am almost completely done with the siding. It's been a long, slow process, partly due to weather and partly due to logistics. For the first: it's been a fairly rainy summer. I obviously can't install siding in the rain, and I like to let the sheathing dry out for at least a day before I do cover it with siding. As to the second cause of delay, the siding I'm using comes in 16' lengths. The longest piece I can put up on my own and keep it straight and level is about 7'. So I can put up siding on my own until I need to install a longer piece, then I need to wait until my eager-to-help but elderly-with-a-bad-knee father-in-law can help. And I can [will] only ask him to help for so long at a time or I know his knee will be killing him for the rest of the day. So it's been going up slowly.</p>
<p>The siding I chose is "LP SmartSide". It's a composite material, like particleboard, but each individual particle is coated with some waterproofing compound before they are bonded together and shaped. It doesn't sound awesome, but it kind of is. It's lighter and more flexible than fiber cement, cheaper than cedar, and way better looking than vinyl. I decided to go with a traditional lap-siding approach because I want my tiny house to aesthetically look like a normal house.</p>
<p>I've also started putting on my metal roof (yeah!). And putting in my interior sheathing!</p>
