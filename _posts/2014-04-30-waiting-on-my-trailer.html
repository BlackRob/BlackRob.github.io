<p>I made a mistake.  All winter long --and it was so long this year-- I was waiting until spring to get my trailer and start my build.  My thinking was that until I had a place to put it (or rather, until the snow had melted and mud dried in the spot I'd chosen) there was no point in getting one.  I had assumed all along that I would buy a trailer off a lot and customize it myself.  But when the weather was finally good enough and I went to the regional mega-trailer dealership, they didn't have any suitable trailers.  I want to go the car hauler route, with extensions welded on the sides to support the walls, and I wanted it to be 24'·  Turns it 24' car haulers are really rare, because cars aren't that long.  If I want a trailer that long, all they had or could order were super heavy duty equipment trailers, in the over $7000 dollar range.  Way out of my price range.  They didn't have any viable used trailers, either, and I'd been searching craigslist for months looking on my own for a good deal, but found nothing.  What to do?</p>
<p>I decided to follow the lead of some other tiny house builders and have a custom trailer built. Special shout out to <a title="my reference trailer" href="http://najhaus.com/2013/03/05/the-eagle-has-landed-the-trailer-comes-home-to-roost/">Kate at NajHaus.com</a>,  whose trailer pics I sent to the builder I chose, saying, "I want your regular car hauler trailer, no deck, with extensions to support the walls, like this!"  It was a little more complicated than that, but that was the basic extent of the deal.  But (and here was my mistake) ordering a custom trailer in springtime, the trailer manufacturer has a back log of work, so it will take about a month to make it.  So now I'm trying to do everything else I can around the house and yard that springtime demands so that when my trailer is ready I can start work immediately.</p>
