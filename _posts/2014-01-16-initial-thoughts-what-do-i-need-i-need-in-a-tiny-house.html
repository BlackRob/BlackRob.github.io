<p>Everyone needs different things.  There is no perfect tiny home that will work for everyone.  Some people <del>like</del> need to cook, others rarely boil water.  Some people need a lot of closet space --and I mean need, as in for their work they have to look not just clean but fashionable, and having only a few outfits just won't cut it.  (We can't all live in jeans and t-shirts.)  Some people need a big bed, while others could get by with a little bunk.  Some people need space to entertain, or make music, or carve wooden gargoyles to sell on Etsy.  Some people need wheelchair accessibility.</p>
<p>The first thing that has to be considered when an individual/couple/family is looking at a small house is what their individual needs are, and choose a plan that works for them.  I wrote "choose a plan", because for almost everyone looking to build/have built a tiny house, it will be more practical to choose from the many existing, tested and drawn out plans than to design one from scratch. I initially thought to purchase plans from <a href="http://http://padtinyhouses.com/">Portland Alternative Dwellings</a>, but in the end decided I wanted the complete design-and-build experience.  But I'm doing it the hard way, and wouldn't recommend this to everyone.</p>
<p>So what do I need in a tiny house?  What do I, Robert Austin, with a longtime girlfriend and an 8 year old daughter, need in a tiny house? Well...</p>
<ul>
<li>Portability.  I don't currently have any land.  There are a few places I could put a tiny house, but none of them permanent, so I have to build it on a trailer.</li>
<li>Beds.  A lot of tiny houses try to maximize one loft.  That won't work for us.  3 people in a queen size bed is too much.  We need a big bed and a little bed.  My idea, actually, is that I would sleep in the little bed, and let the ladies take the bigger one.  We currently have a king size bed, despite the fact that I'm not a king .  When my daughter is sick or scared of a thunderstorm, or claiming to be scared because she'd rather sleep in the big bed, she'll climb in with us.  Mama loves it, me not so much.  You know what I like? Separate beds for couples.  Not having to share blankets is one less thing to argue about, and honestly, even happy couples need a little personal space.  Like these two lovebirds:<br />

<li>A kitchen. I like to cook. But I can get by without a built-in oven.  I prefer an induction "burner" and a good toaster oven.  They use less power, take up less space and you can bake a pie in one.  That's enough for me.</li>
<li>A bathroom with a shower.  A tiny tub would have been nice, and I looked, but I couldn't find a good one that was small enough and affordable.</li>
<li>Room for a sitting "circle" for company.</li>
<li>A dining/work table.</li>
<li>Room for at least two overnight guests.  We've been living with her parents (my <em>de facto</em>  in-laws) for years now, and although it can be trying, I love the extended family thing, and think it's great for the kid and the grandparents.  So we need room for them to sleep over occasionally.  I can't build a house and say, "Sorry, no room for old people."</li>
<li>Off-gridability.  The house has to still be livable if I pull it out to the middle of a field and start raising goats.  Which isn't such a big deal, but it means the house can't rely on external water and sewer, and needs to have water storage inside the shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about all I can think of.  Oh, a washing machine.  But that's about the last thing I'll buy.</p>
