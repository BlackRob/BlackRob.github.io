<p>It has been almost two months now since I was fired from a job that I hated. These have been the happiest two months I've had in a long time, too. Coincidence? I don't think so.</p>
<p>I've had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do as the next act of my life. Should I get another job... should I start a business, if so what kind.... Finally I decided to build a tiny house on a trailer. Which may seem kind of random, but I've had the itch to build a house for pretty much my entire life (my dad built the house I grew up in), and if I don't do it now I probably won't get another window of opportunity like this (between jobs, so I have the time, and some money saved up).</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Anyway, I'll probably write more about myself in the future, but this blog isn't about me.  It's mostly about the what, why and how of the tiny house I'm building.   It's gonna be sweet.</span></p>
