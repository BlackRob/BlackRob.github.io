<p>To build on my previous post, by removing the rear mini gable I get the following</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_51" align="alignnone" width="1450"]<a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/no_back_gable.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-51" alt="no_back_gable" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/no_back_gable.jpg" width="1450" height="864" /></a> I don't even know if gable is the right word... the roof had dual ridges, one was just shorter than the other, a gable is a little different....[/caption]</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">A bit simpler to build, and no difference in useable space.</span></p>
<p>Or go all the way, make it real simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://workingclasshouses.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/nogables.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" alt="nogables" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/nogables.jpg" width="1450" height="864" /></a></p>
<p>This last picture shows off the problem with the roof line being too close to the top of the windows.  That can be adjusted... if I move the ridgeline closer to the front of the house (say a foot) I'd get an extra four inches.  I'll have to play with it.</p>
