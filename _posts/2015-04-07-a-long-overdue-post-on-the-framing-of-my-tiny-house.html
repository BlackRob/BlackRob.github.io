<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
<p>I've mentioned before that I have some shortcomings as a blogger, one of them being regularity of posting. So here are some photos from last July and August, when I actually framed, sheathed and roofed my house. I'm a little disappointed in myself that during the whole process, when I had a camera-phone on my person the entire time, I took so few pictures, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I built individual sections of framing that were about at the limits of what I could lift, then got help when it was time to stand them up. I knew that when I asked for help I had to be ready to be productive. It worked out fairly well. The framing took one day, the sheathing a second. I lifted sheets of plywood up on the rafters and tacked them in place so I could cover the whole thing with a couple of tarps. I managed to get it covered just before it rained.</p>
<p>I want to thank my father-in-law, Juris (George), my neighbor John, an old friend and coworker Soo, and my brother Gary for their help with putting up the frame. I literally could not have done it without them.</p>
<p>I apparently didn't take a single picture the entire day Gary was helping me put the sheathing on.</p>
<p>The house has been in this condition for pretty much the entire winter. After it was weather tight, I had to turn my attention to <a title="Things that have happened" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2015/02/26/things-that-have-happened.html">a different project</a>, that took up most of my time. But now I'm back at it. I ordered the siding and it should come some time this week. I built a loft. I built a ladder. I have a second loft and a second ladder started. Good times.</p>
