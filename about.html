<h1>About...</h1>
<section>
<h2>this site</h2>
<p>This site started as a blog for the tiny house I was building. Over time, I realized that I'm tempermentally not much of a blogger --updates became very infrequent-- so I transitioned the site to its current format. It's mainly intended as a portfolio of the things that I've built and written over the years, and moving forward. </p>

<h2>me</h2>
<p>My name's Robert Austin, I have a computer engineering degree from Michigan State University. I'm a writer and a maker. Neither one of those things pays the bills, but that's the ideal outcome of my actions, that someday I will get paid to write and make things, and I won't have to work a regular job. (Jobs are bullshit anyway.)</p>
