<h1>About...</h1>

<h2>this site</h2>
<p>This site started as a blog for the tiny house I was building. Over time, I realized that I'm tempermentally not much of a blogger --updates became very infrequent-- so I transitioned the site to its current format (static and served from Github pages, instead of paying for hosting I was barely using).  It's mainly intended as a portfolio of the things that I've built and written over the years.  I might add a few things eventually.</p>

<h2>me</h2>
<p>My name's Robert Austin, I have a computer engineering degree from Michigan State University. I'm a writer and a maker. Neither one of those things pays the bills, but that's the ideal outcome of my actions, that someday I will get paid to write and make things, and I won't have to work a regular job.</p>
<p>If for some reason you want to contact me, I'm robert dot w dot austin at gmail dot com, and I have a minor footprint on social media at these places:<p>
